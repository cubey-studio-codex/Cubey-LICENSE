==========================================================================================================================================

1. PREAMBLE AND CORE PHILOSOPHY
This License is a binding legal agreement between Cubey Studio Codex (the 
"Licensor") and any individual or entity (the "Licensee") that downloads, 
installs, or utilizes the Cube Studio 2D-X framework. This software is provided 
as "Source-Available" for educational and personal growth, maintaining a strict 
boundary against unauthorized commercial exploitation while enforcing the 
highest standards of modern C++ engineering.

2. DEFINITIONS
2.1. "Software" refers to the Cube Studio 2D-X engine, its source code, 
headers, assets, and the proprietary Codex-Bridge interop system.
2.2. "Codex-Bridge" refers to the specialized binding layer facilitating 
communication between C++26 logic and the Lua 5.4 scripting environment.
2.3. "Derivative Works" means any software that builds upon, modifies, or 
links to the Software's core modules.
2.4. "Commercial Use" refers to any activity intended for or directed toward 
commercial advantage or monetary compensation, including but not limited to 
sales, ad-revenue, or paid services.

3. MANDATORY TECHNICAL COMPLIANCE (C++17 - C++26)
3.1. LANGUAGE VERSIONING: The Licensee is strictly prohibited from compiling 
the Software using C++ standards older than ISO/IEC 14882:2017 (C++17).
3.2. CORE MODULES: The software utilizes C++20 Concepts, C++23 std::expected, 
and C++26 static reflection. Removing or modifying these to accommodate legacy 
compilers is a violation of this License.
3.3. COMPILER RESTRICTION: Use is only authorized via modern compilers 
compatible with Visual Studio 2026 (MSVC v144+) or Clang 18+.
3.4. THREAD SAFETY: Any modification to the core's asynchronous loading 
mechanisms must adhere to the C++23 memory model for atomic operations.

4. GRANT OF USAGE RIGHTS
4.1. NON-COMMERCIAL USE: Licensor grants a non-exclusive license to use the 
Software for personal, non-profit, and academic research.
4.2. MODIFICATION: Licensee may modify the source code for local, private 
development and optimization purposes.
4.3. REDISTRIBUTION: Redistribution of source code is permitted only if this 
LICENSE file remains intact and unaltered in the root directory.

5. COMMERCIAL RESTRICTIONS AND REVENUE GATE
5.1. ZERO REVENUE POLICY: This license version does not permit the generation 
of revenue (0.00 USD limit).
5.2. MANDATORY CONVERSION: If the Licensee's project enters a commercial 
phase, a signed Commercial EULA from Cubey Studio Codex is required.
5.3. SUB-LICENSING: Licensee shall not sub-license, rent, or lease the 
Software as a standalone engine or development kit.

6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND BRANDING
6.1. NAMESPACE RESERVATION: The global namespaces "cs", "cubey", and "codex" 
are the property of the Licensor.
6.2. BRANDING: The official "Cubey Studio Codex" logo must be displayed for 
at least 2.0 seconds during the application's boot sequence.
6.3. TRADEMARKS: Use of the name "Cube Studio 2D-X" in marketing requires 
explicit attribution to the Licensor.

7. CODEX-BRIDGE AND LUA INTEROP INTEGRITY
7.1. BINDING SECURITY: Licensees shall not alter the stack-registry logic of 
the Codex-Bridge in a way that creates memory vulnerabilities.
7.2. LUA VERSIONING: Only Lua 5.4.x or higher is authorized for use with 
the provided binding headers.
7.3. NAMESPACE POLLUTION: Injecting non-engine variables into the "cs" 
table is forbidden to ensure future C++26 compatibility.

8. RENDERING PROTOCOLS AND SHADER USAGE
8.1. BACKEND INTEGRITY: The rendering pipeline (Vulkan/OpenGL) must not be 
stripped of its optimization flags.
8.2. SHADER ATTRIBUTION: Proprietary GLSL/HLSL shaders included in the 
Software are subject to the same protections as the C++ source.

9. DEVELOPMENT ETHICS AND LEGAL CONDUCT
9.1. MALICIOUS USE: The Software shall not be used to create malware, 
ransomware, or tools for unauthorized data collection.
9.2. COMPLIANCE: Licensee must comply with all international laws regarding 
data privacy (GDPR) and digital security.

10. WARRANTY AND LIABILITY
10.1. AS-IS: THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.
10.2. LIMITATION: LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DATA LOSS, HARDWARE 
DAMAGE, OR FINANCIAL LOSS RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE.

11. TERMINATION
11.1. BREACH: Failure to comply with Technical (Sec 3) or Commercial (Sec 5) 
clauses results in immediate termination.
11.2. EFFECT: Upon termination, Licensee must delete all copies of the 
Software and derivative binaries.

12. JURISDICTION AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION
12.1. GOVERNING LAW: This License is governed by the laws of the 
jurisdiction where Cubey Studio Codex operates.
12.2. DISPUTES: Any legal challenge must be filed in the courts designated 
by the Licensor.

13. CONTRIBUTIONS AND PULL REQUESTS
13.1. OWNERSHIP: Contributions submitted to the official repository 
become the property of Cubey Studio Codex.
13.2. LICENSING: All contributions are automatically governed by CL-1.0.

14. MISCELLANEOUS
14.1. SEVERABILITY: If any part of this license is found invalid, the 
remainder remains in full effect.

GitHub commit at any time.
